# WeatherApp
This application uses REST API and Retrofit library to retreive weather data from the 
website : "http://openweathermap.org". The data can be retreived for the current location of the 
android device, or for an entered city name that we want to know about its weather.
These data include humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, presuure and wind speed.
Also, the app retreives the photo representing weather status from the same website.
Java is the language that the app is implemented in.
